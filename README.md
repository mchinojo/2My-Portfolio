# On-the-job Project 01: Code Refactor

## Description 

This project is about building a portfolio page, which I can add to as the course progresses. 
So far I have only one deployed web application, so for now that it will be the one who has a working link. Hopefully I will have more deployed projects in the next weeks.
I will put on practice some skills Iâ€™ve recently learned, like flexbox, girds, media queries and CSS variables.

Here is a link to the deployed application: https://mchinojo.github.io/mchinojoDay8Challenge/


## Installation

Clone the project and open it using your favourite browser (I recommend using Chrome).


## Usage 

Here is a screenshot of how the website should look, so you can compare it with my project. They are supossed to resemble at least in a 90%.

The following animation shows how the web application's  supposed to look and function, although I was free to use my own colours and images.
